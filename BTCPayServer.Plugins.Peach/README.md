# Peach plugin for BTCPay Server
Sell your Bitcoins Peer-to-Peer to individuals using <a href="https://peachbitcoin.com/referral/?code=PROB44" target="new">Peach Bitcoin</a> !
This plugin allows you to forward received onchain BTC funds to your Peach account, by creating Sell Offer that Peach users can interact with.

# Settings

The first thing to do is to have a Peach account, with your payment methods clearly defined.
From the app, you must create a backup from the Peach app (Settings / Backups / File Backup).
You must now specify a password to secure the file.

# Using the Peach Plugin

The Peach Plugin displays your Onchain Balance and the Fiat exchange rate in the store currency.
You can set the percentage of your balance to sell and the premium ( example: you want to sell 2 BTC in exchange for Euros at a price that is 5% above the market price defined by Centralized Exchanges)<br/>
