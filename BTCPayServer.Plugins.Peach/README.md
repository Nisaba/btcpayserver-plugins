Sell your bitcoins peer-to-peer to individuals usins <a href="https://peachbitcoin.com/referral/?code=PROB44" target="new">Peach Bitcoin</a> !
This plugin allows you to forward received onchain BTC funds to your Peach account, by creating a sales offer that Peach users can respond to.

# Settings

The first thing to do is to have a Peach account, with your payment methods clearly defined.
From the app, you must create a backup from the Peach app (Settings / Backups / File Backup).
You must now specify a password to secure the file.

<br/>Now you can retrieve the generated JSON file and import it into the Peach plugin, specifying the password that was set.<br/>

# Using Peach Plugin

The plugin displays your onchain balance and the fiat exchange rate in the store currency.
You can set the percentage of the balance to sell.

Clicking Search displays a list of currently available purchase offers that match your criteria (balances and payment methods).
This is simply a way to check the status of current offers. To respond to them, you must create a sale offer.<br/>

<br/>To do this, and if you haven't already done so, you must enter the password, the one you defined when backing up your JSON file from the Peach application.
Now you can create a sales offer, optionally specifying a premium, positive or negative.<br/>

<br/>Great! The sell offer is created ! You can see it in your Peach app.<br/>

<br/>Now you need to pay the escrow to activate it. Click on the link provided. It will simply take you to the BTCPay payouts page, with a payout already configured to be sent to Peach, with the correct amount and receiving address. All you have to do is make this payment for your Peach offer to be effective. Its status will be updated in the app.<br/>
