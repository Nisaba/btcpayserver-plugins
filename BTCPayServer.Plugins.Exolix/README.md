# Exolix plugin for BTCPay Server
This plugin allows merchants to accept altcoins as a payment method. It must be installed via the BTCPay Server plugin plugin admin page in your instance.

The principle is as follows: During checkout, the buyer pays in altcoins to a service provider who performs a bitcoin swap to the address generated by BTCPay for the checkout.
This allows BTCPay to transparently consider the invoice as paid.

Similar plugins for BTCPay already exist. However, this one uses Exolix as the swap service provider. Furthermore, there are no intrusive IFRAMEs at checkout, which can disrupt the customer and hinder their purchasing process. Instead, payment with altcoins respects the BTCPay user experience for a smoother checkout process.

Since 1.1.0 version, you can also, as merchant, swap your balance.

## Settings
Exolix generates the bitcoin payment as soon as the altcoin transaction is confirmed, according to the terms of the blockchain used. Therefore, in the store settings, it is advisable to specify a sufficient time limit for invoice expiration.

Please also note that Exolix requires a minimum amount for a swap to work, around 10 USD.
If this amount is not reached, the swap cannot be completed.

The plugin settings must be configured for each BTCPay store. It is accessible to users with the "CanModifyStoreSettings" permission.

You must activate the plugin and select the desired cryptocurrencies from the list during checkout.
For the plugin to be active, it must be activated and at least one altcoin must be selected.
